# TLA+ introduction material

I am giving a talk on TLA+ called "Introduction to TLA+" or "Leverage the power of the first order logic with TLA+" or another title around this idea.

When learning TLA+, I had some issues understanding the concepts behind the syntax. I dropped it. I then read [Software Abstractions](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Abstractions-Logic-Language-Analysis/dp/0262017156) which presents Alloy through the lens of logic. It was clear to me that getting the underlying principles is more important in formal languages than the syntax.

Now that I learned TLA+, and that the existing material does not seem to cover first order logic (or predicate logic), I figured I would do my own talk. This repository contains all the resources that can be a good follow up to my talk.

## Resources of the talk
